My very first website! Had a lot of fun learning HTML and CSS. If you like my design, feel free to use it!

This was my first attempt at web development. I wanted to make a personal website and I really wanted to learn out of 
that process. There might be bugs but I will be working on my website for a long time as I learn more skills.

This website is not mobile friendly yet so that is my next project : responsive web design
