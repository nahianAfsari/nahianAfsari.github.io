	<h1 class="section_title">About My Art</h1>
	<br><br>
	<p class="content">I have always loved drawing and painting. I was 8 years old when I started drawing. I absolutely loved drawing humans. Something about the features and characteristics of the human species as a whole always intrigued me. As I was getting closer and closer to drawing realistic humans, my parents stopped me from drawing them. They said it was only in the hands of God to generate humans, that I may not try to copy the actions of God. My argument was always that I am only admiring the work of God although I could never convince them. </p>
	
	<p class="content">I am not very religious but I had respect for my parents' wishes so I stopped drawing humans...
	<br><br>
	<div class="section_title">Until</div>
	<br><br>
    <p class="content">I found another way to draw humans. I was introduced to the world of abstraction. Now I could draw humans that imply they are human figures but they're not really human. I came up with my own artistic signature of drawing humans. I got around my parents' rule by abstractifying the human species. I fell in love with abstraction so much that I turned regular paintings into abstract paintings. It didn't matter if it was a human or if it was the sky, I made it abstract. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
 	<div class="section_title">Abstract Paintings</div>  
 	<br><br>
 	<p class="content">Something about abstract paintings now caught my eye. I could make compositions outside the realms of reality. I could make compositions that mimic reality yet distort it enough to confuse viewers. It was amazing and the possibilities were endless. I was very entertained by the different interpretations a single piece of abstract art could have based on the viewer's perspective and experiences.</p> 
 	<br><br>
 	<div class="section_title">I found my style</div>
 	<br><br>
 	<p class="content">Every artist has a signature style. Gogh had impressionism, Picasso had cubism, Warhol had pop art, Dali had surrealism, and I have something I have yet to give a name to but the important fact is that I have something. I have a style. My style is not amazing or revolutionizing like the artists that I just mentioned but my artworks now carry a personailty. </p> 

 	<p class="content">I am in no way, anywhere close to as amazing as the artists I just mentioned. In fact, I still consider myself a newbie to the art world and I am still in the process of developing my style further but I am hoping, maybe a 100 years from now, somebody will point at a painting and say "Hey, that's an Afsari!".</p>
