	<br><br>
	<p class="content">I have always loved drawing and painting. I was 6 years old when I started drawing. I absolutely loved drawing humans. Something about the features and characteristics of the human species as a whole always intrigued me. As I was getting closer and closer to drawing realistic humans, my parents stopped me from drawing them. They said it was only in the hands of God to generate humans, that I may not try to copy the actions of God. My argument was always that I am only admiring the work of God although I could never convince them. </p>
	
	<p class="content">I am not very religious but I had respect for my parents' wishes so I stopped drawing humans...

	<br><br>
    <p class="content">I found another way to draw humans. I was introduced to the world of abstraction. Now I could draw humans that imply they are human figures but they're not really human. I came up with my own artistic signature of drawing humans. I got around my parents' rule by abstractifying the human species. I fell in love with abstraction so much that I turned regular paintings into abstract paintings. It didn't matter if it was a human or if it was the sky, I made it abstract.

 	<p class="content">Something about abstract paintings caught my eye. I could make compositions outside the realms of reality. I could make compositions that mimic reality yet distort it enough to confuse viewers. It was amazing and the possibilities were endless. I was very entertained by the different interpretations a single piece of abstract art could have based on the viewer's perspective and experiences.
