	<p class="content">I have always loved drawing and painting. I was 8 years old when I started drawing. For some reason, I was always drawn to painting human figures but was told not to by my parents for their personal beliefs. Since I had to get around it somehow, I decided to make abstract paintings. Now I could draw humans that imply they are human figures but they're not really human.  </p>

	<p class="content">I drew a lot of these abstract human figures back in 2015 when I was a junior in high school so my gallery page is a display of some of those artworks I made during that time. Click on “Visit My Gallery” to see them!
