	<h1 class="section_title">Hi</h1>
	<br><br>
	<p class="content"> My name is Nahian Afsari. I am a junior at University of Texas at Dallas studying computer science.
    </p>
    <p class="content">I wasn’t always interested in computer science. In fact, I started out with art. I have been drawing since I was 8. In highschool, I was very engaged with drawing and painting. I have always liked creating. Creating something out of nothing, using tools to make things better and brighter was my passion and it still is. 
    <br><br>
    In 11th grade, I started loving mathematics. Problem solving and the pure simplicity of math caught my eyes. Don’t get me wrong. I do not underestimate the complexities of math but I loved how an answer to a problem is either right or wrong. It wasn’t like art. Art was subjective, art allowed me to explore the horizons while math let me combine my adventure to one single optimal solution.</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="section_title">And Then</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">I found computer science. When I was first introduced to computer science in the 12th grade, I was amazed. It was exactly my two favorite subjects combined into one. If art and mathematics had a child, it would be computer science. In computer science, I was allowed to explore absolutely anything my mind can think of, I could be an artist, I could create something out of nothing, it was everything I enjoyed about art. On the other hand, to make my visions come to life, I had to be logical, I had to problem solve to bring my imagination into reality. My solution to my visions was either right or it was wrong, if it was wrong, I had to go back in and problem solve further which is exactly the aspects I enjoyed about mathematics. </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="section_title">I Found My Passion</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">Most people would say that art and math are from two completely different worlds and if I hadn’t found computer science, I would say the same. I am glad I didn’t have to choose between becoming an Artist and a Mathematician, I am glad I get to be a Computer Scientist.</p>
    <br><br>
  
    <div class="section_title">What I do For Fun</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">I do not code 24/7 like how most people envision programmers to be. I am not the “Eat.Code.Sleep.Repeat” kind of programmer. I’m more like “Eat.Code.WatchUngodlyAmountOfMovies.Sleep.Repeat” kind of a programmer. 
    <br><br>
    As mentioned above, I enjoy watching a lot of movies. If you need movie suggestions, do not contact me because I forgot the titles of every movie I have ever watched upto last week with the exceptions of “Charlie & The Chocolate Factory”(2001) & the Batman Trilogy movie titles because they're my favorite :) </p>
   <br><br>
    <div class="section_title">Where you can find my art</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">If you go to the main menu, there’s an option called “Gallery” where some of my artworks are displayed. I do not sell my artworks nor do I do commision painting because it’s hard for me give up my artworks to strangers because there is a possibility I may never see my physical-original work. The only people who have my artworks are people who have gotten them as gifts. If you want one of my pieces, be nice to me or something. I’ll give you one for your birthday. (This is also one of the reasons I can never become a professional artist...)
    </p>

    <div class="section_title">Bye</div>
