	<h1 class="section_title">Hi</h1>
	<br><br>
	<p class="content"> My name is Nahian Afsari. I am a junior at University of Texas at Dallas studying computer science.
    </p>
    <p class="content">I wasn’t always interested in computer science. In fact, I started out with art. I have been drawing since I was 8. In highschool, I was very engaged with drawing and painting. I have always liked creating. Creating something out of nothing, using tools to make things better and brighter was my passion and it still is. 
    <br><br>
    In 11th grade, I started loving mathematics. Problem solving and the pure simplicity of math caught my eyes. I do not underestimate the complexities of math but I loved how an answer to a problem is either right or wrong. It wasn’t like art. Art was subjective, art allowed me to explore the horizons while math let me combine my adventure to one single optimal solution.</p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="section_title">And Then</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">I found computer science. When I was first introduced to computer science in the 12th grade, I was amazed. It was exactly my two favorite subjects combined into one. If art and mathematics were combined into a single subject, it would be computer science. In computer science, I was allowed to explore absolutely anything my mind can think of, I could be an artist, I could create something out of nothing, it was everything I enjoyed about art. On the other hand, to make my visions come to life, I had to be logical, I had to problem solve to bring my imagination into reality. My solution to my visions was either right or it was wrong, if it was wrong, I had to go back in and problem solve further which is exactly the aspects I enjoyed about mathematics. </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="section_title">I Found My Passion</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">Most people would say that art and math are from two completely different worlds and if I hadn’t found computer science, I would say the same. I got extremely lucky to not have to choose between my two passions. </p>
    <br><br>
  
    <div class="section_title">What I do For Fun</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">I watch an ungodly amount of movies in my spare time but don't ask me for movie suggestions because I already forgot the title of the movie I watched last night. I like trying out different restaurants with my friends. I'm also a boba drink fanatic so essentially I am a walking yelp for boba places around Dallas :)
    </p>
   <br><br>
    <div class="section_title">Where you can find my art</div>
    <br><br>
    <p class="content">If you go to the main menu, there’s an option called “Gallery” where some of my artworks are displayed. I do not sell my artworks nor do I do commision painting because I like making art as a hobby and making a business out of it would kill the fun for me. If you want one of my pieces, be nice to me or something, I’ll give you one for your birthday.
    </p>
